# Elegent-Conky-Theme

I have made this conky theme when I was customising my desktop. It looks better in elegent type wallpaper.
# Installation
Copy the conky.conf into the ``` ~/.conky  ```(Hidden folder on home directory)
# NOTE : 
You are free to edit this theme for further improvment. If you want to watch Wi-fi related info copy the wifi-config.txt file into your own conkyryc.conf . Same rule applies for for the network-config.txt for displaying network related info.If the font doesn't look great in your screen adjust the size in ``` font Monospace:size= .own_window_type ``` . If don't work properly in some Desktop Environment, change it if necessary.``` own_window_type dock ``` Options: (normal, desktop, dock, panel or override)
# VERSION INFO
 Version 1.0 has some problems with the font and window size. It is fixed and version 1.1 comes with the new network monitoring. The netork monitoring works both on Wifi and Cellular connections.
