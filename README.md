# Elegent-Conky-Theme

I have made this conky theme when I was customising my desktop. It looks better in elegent type wallpaper.
# Installation
Copy the conky.conf into the ~/.conky (Hidden folder on home directory)
# NOTE : 
You are free to edit this theme for further improvment. If you want to watch Wi-fi related info copy the wifi-config.txt file into your own conkyryc.conf . Same rule applies for for the network-config.txt for displaying network related info.If the font doesn't look great in your screen adjust the size in ``` font Monospace:size= .own_window_type ``` . If don't work properly in some Desktop Environment, change it if necessary.``` own_window_type dock ``` Options: (normal, desktop, dock, panel or override)
